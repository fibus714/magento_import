import script for magento


This is an import script to go from sextoyclub.com to magento.  This script will download the product list and image packs from the distributor sextoyclub.com/
After you choose they category you wish to import into your magento store it will import all items and images into a temporary database.
From that temporary database you can do a csv export and use magentos built in import script to import the products.


Dont forget to update your DB connection string
Set the category you wish to work with and import
Read the notes in the script





!!!!Disclaimer!!!
This script has not been worked on in a while. If it does not work I'm sorry I cannot support it.  If it is helpful to some then that is awesome!
